# NoteBuddy 🦷🗣️

NoteBuddy is a voice-to-note transcription tool designed for dentists. It allows users to record patient visit notes verbally, and it automatically transcribes and formats them into clean, professional medical documentation — saving time and reducing manual entry.

This tool was created during a personal exploration into AI-powered productivity tools for healthcare. It is built with Python and integrates OpenAI's Whisper for speech-to-text and GPT-3.5 for note refinement.
